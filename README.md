# Project-Flashcards

This app is designed to be used by a local school, to help students study online. Teachers will use this application to create decks of flashcards for the subjects that they teach, and students will study the decks. I used JavaScript, React, HTML, and Bootstrap to build this app.


I managed the State using React Hooks like useState, useEffect.

I manage routes and links using React Router Library.
